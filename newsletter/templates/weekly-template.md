## 🔍 HOW TO USE THIS DATA

**What to look for:**
• **Multiple insiders buying** (cluster effect) - Stronger signal than single purchase
• **CEOs/CFOs buying** - Top executives have best company visibility
• **Open-market purchases** - Real conviction (not option exercises or grants)
• **Buying after 10%+ drops** - Insiders buying the dip often signals confidence

**Important reminders:**
• Insider buying is a *signal*, not a guarantee
• Insider selling is less reliable (they sell for many reasons)
• Always combine with your own research
• This is educational content, not investment advice
