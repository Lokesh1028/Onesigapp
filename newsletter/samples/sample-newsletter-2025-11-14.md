## 📝 THIS WEEK'S INSIGHT

**The Power of Cluster Buying**

This week we saw an unusually strong pattern: cluster buying in semiconductor stocks. Not just NVDA - we tracked 12 separate insider purchases across NVDA, AMD, AVGO, and ARM. This is the highest semiconductor insider buying volume since June 2025.

Why does this matter? When multiple insiders across different companies in the same sector are buying simultaneously, it often indicates sector-wide confidence. These executives have visibility into chip demand, manufacturing capacity, and customer orders that the public market doesn't.

The pattern suggests insiders believe the AI infrastructure build-out has more room to run, despite recent stock pullbacks. Of course, past performance doesn't guarantee future results, but cluster buying has historically been a reliable leading indicator.

**Historical context:** The last time we saw this level of semiconductor cluster buying was Q2 2024, right before the sector rallied 35% over the next 6 months. Worth watching.

## 🔍 HOW TO USE THIS DATA

**What to look for:**
• **Multiple insiders buying** (cluster effect) - Stronger signal than single purchase
• **CEOs/CFOs buying** - Top executives have best company visibility
• **Open-market purchases** - Real conviction (not option exercises or grants)
• **Buying after 10%+ drops** - Insiders buying the dip often signals confidence

**Important reminders:**
• Insider buying is a *signal*, not a guarantee
• Insider selling is less reliable (they sell for many reasons)
• Always combine with your own research
• This is educational content, not investment advice
